# Chapter 1: Consumer Theory

## Utility Functions
Utility represents preferences. Example:

$$
U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{0.5} \cdot x_2^{0.5}
$$

where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are quantities of goods.

## Budget Constraint
The budget line is:

$$
p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 \leq M
$$

where $M$ is income.

```{r}
# Example: Plot a budget line in R
p1 <- 2; p2 <- 1; M <- 10
x1 <- seq(0, M/p1, 0.1)
x2 <- (M - p1*x1)/p2

plot(x1, x2, type="l", col="blue", lwd=2,
     xlab="Good 1", ylab="Good 2",
     main="Budget Line")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
